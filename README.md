Personal config files that I find useful. YMMV if you use any of these files/settings.

vim
--------------------
You will need to make sure that the full version of `vim` is installed. Type in `vim`:

     :version

and if it returns:

      Small version without GUI.

You will get one or more errors that state ...`E319: Sorry, the command is not available in this version: ` followed by the name of the command in the `vimrc` file.
